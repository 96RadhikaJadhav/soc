- Recommended Skills: javascript
- Mentor(s): [Jithin Emmanuel](github.com/jithine), [Tiffany Kyi](https://github.com/tkyi/)
- Issues:

    1. [Generate and use deploy keys](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/screwdriver/issues/1079) during build pipeline creation.

        For building your project Screwdriver either requires the Github repository of your project to have public read access or to provide authentication via SCM Tokens exposed as [Secrets](https://docs.screwdriver.cd/user-guide/configuration/secrets). But a better approach would be to use [deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) if available.

    2. Notify SCM changes from [external SCM repositories](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/screwdriver/issues/1415). 

        Enable building your Screwdriver pipeline when source code changes happen on any Github repositories.
